XII. SUBJECTIVE THERMO-CURRENCY
(STC): In conventional economic systems,
money functions as an intermediary for the
indirect exchange of goods and services.
However, this mechanism often falls short in
justly compensating individuals for the effort
they invest in producing these goods and
services.
Numerous
factors,
such
as
appearance, nationality, gender, geographical
location, or even luck, can lead to unjust
disparities in compensation, resulting in issues
like scarcity and criminality.
As aptly articulated by Tommy Fox,
"We cannot hope to resolve
scarcity using a tool that is itself scarce."
Subjective Thermo-Currency (STC) endeavors
to address this predicament by ascribing value
to the energy expended and absorbed by
individuals during their engagements. This
process occurs through the utilization of
virtual energy glands located within their
hands and shoulders.
The determination of energy value within
the Subjective Thermo-Currency system relies
heavily on cutting-edge KnowledgeHooks
processing technology. This technology
seamlessly incorporates energy calculations as
an inherent aspect of KnowledgeHooks
themselves. KnowledgeHooks, in this context,
are deemed effective when they contribute to
energy conservation in a user's own BodyParts
or those of others, thereby reducing effort and
enhancing overall comfort while achieving
desired outcomes.
The implementation of Subjective Thermo-
Currency aligns individuals' incentives with
the fundamental principles governing the
natural world and the universally applicable
laws of physics.
The concept of Subjective Thermo-
Currency has undergone rigorous examination
in various domains, including but not limited
to:
Scarcity: Within the realm of Subjective
Thermo-Currency, scarcity is portrayed as the
energy individuals expend in their quest to
acquire a resource. This unique perspective on
scarcity introduces a novel dimension to
resource allocation.
Unemployment and Hunger: These two
challenges are intricately linked, and
Subjective Thermo-Currency ingeniously
addresses this correlation. In this paradigm,
the balance for idleness is gracefully
synchronized with one's ever-present basal
metabolism. The elegance of this system lies in
its inherent capacity to align with principles of
social justice, effortlessly reconciling societal
needs with the inherent properties of human
physiology
Poverty: Poverty often stems from a dearth of
capital, hindering individuals from engaging in
productive work. Subjective Thermo-Currency
offers a natural remedy to this issue. Here,
energy stands as the readily available currency,
with each person's intrinsic energy reserves
residing in their Heart Virtual BodyPart.
Inflation: In the realm of Subjective Thermo-
Currency, the concept of inflation dissolves
into the annals of history. Energy, as the
foundational unit of exchange, remains a
constant, impervious to fluctuations or
manipulations.
Politics: Politics, a construct often necessitated
by the inherent problems associated with
traditional monetary systems, finds a different
role within Subjective Thermo-Currency. With
the elimination of currency as an intermediary,
politics shifts from crisis management to more
meaningful pursuits.
Monopolies and Cartels: These entities, known
for price-fixing and exploiting the population,
lose their grip within the Subjective Thermo-
Currency framework. Energy calculations,
grounded in physics, ensure fair and
transparent resource allocation.
Slavery: The concept of slavery becomes an
anachronism within Subjective Thermo-
Currency. The system's fundamental design
precludes any form of control over an
individual's virtual energy glands, making
exploitation impossible.
Physical Labor: Subjective Thermo-Currency
rewards physical labor by valuing the energy
expended in work. Individuals receive energy
from their shoulder's virtual glands, which is
stored in their Heart Battery BodyPart.
Intellectual Labor: Intellectual labor, while
demanding minimal energy expenditure,
contributes
significantly
to
energy
conservation.
Individuals
who
provide
intellectual insights receive energy savings from
users who benefit from their work and have
increased their comfort.
Artistic Labor: Artistic endeavors are duly
recognized within this paradigm. Consider a
scenario where a runner discovers a poem and
subsequently the author absorbs the energy
differential from the runner's exertion during
their creative process. Artistic contributions
align with a relaxing energy expenditure
equivalent to reserving a bed for rest.
Security: Subjective Thermo-Currency ensures
robust security without the need for an
internet connection. Energy transactions are
securely stored and executed within an
individual's self-contained system, ensuring
data integrity and privacy.
Environmental Impact: One of the most
significant impacts of Subjective Thermo-
Currency lies in its potential to contribute to
environmental sustainability. In traditional
monetary systems, the pursuit of wealth often
leads to resource depletion and environmental
degradation. However, Subjective Thermo-
Currency values work based on the energy
expended, which inherently connects economic
activity with the physical world.
1. Resource Conservation: Since energy is
the fundamental unit of exchange,
individuals are incentivized to engage in
activities that require less energy, thus
reducing
unnecessary
resource
consumption.
2. Environmental Awareness: The system
encourages individuals to be more
conscious of their energy expenditure.
This awareness can extend to daily
choices, such as transportation methods or
energy-efficient appliances, leading to
reduced carbon footprints.
3. Renewable
Energy
Integration:
Subjective Thermo-Currency seamlessly
integrates with renewable energy sources.
By valuing energy in all its forms,
including sustainable sources like solar
and wind power, the system fosters the
adoption of cleaner energy alternatives.
Waste Reduction: The emphasis on energy
efficiency encourages innovation in waste
reduction and recycling, aligning economic
success with ecological responsibility.
Alignment with Natural Phenomena:
Subjective Thermo-Currency aligns with
several naturally occurring phenomena,
reflecting the elegance and efficiency found in
the natural world.
Energy
Conservation:
Nature
demonstrates remarkable efficiency in
energy utilization. Subjective Thermo-
Currency mimics this by valuing work
based on energy expenditure, promoting
resource conservation.
Homeostasis: Natural systems strive for
balance and stability. Similarly, Subjective
Thermo-Currency seeks to achieve
economic equilibrium by valuing work and
compensation in a manner that aligns with
the inherent energy flows within the
ecosystem.
Reciprocity: Many natural ecosystems
exhibit symbiotic relationships, where
organisms exchange resources for mutual
benefit.
Subjective
Thermo-Currency
encourages collaboration and cooperation
by valuing contributions based on energy
savings.
Adaptation: Natural systems are adaptable
and evolve over time. Subjective Thermo-
Currency's flexibility allows it to adapt to
changing economic landscapes and
evolving societal needs.
Complexity: Natural systems often exhibit
complex and interconnected relationships.
Subjective Thermo-Currency's intricate
web of energy transactions reflects the
complexity and interdependence inherent
in the natural world.
In summary, Subjective Thermo-Currency not
only addresses socio-economic challenges but
also demonstrates a remarkable alignment
with environmentally sustainable practices
and natural phenomena. This alignment has
the potential to foster a more harmonious
relationship between human activities, the
economy, and the environment, ultimately
contributing to a more sustainable and
equitable future.
These innovations collectively demonstrate the
transformative
potential
of
Subjective
Thermo-Currency across diverse socio-
economic challenges.
Figure 12 illustrates a human being who has undergone virtual evolution,
facilitated by Subjective BodyParts. This evolution enables the
individual to efficiently transfer energy through their hands, shoulders,
facilitating both the exertion and absorption of energy. Additionally,
this advanced system integrates with the individual's heart battery.
XIII. SUBJECTIVE ADS: A groundbreaking
approach to advertising that stands in stark
contrast to traditional branding methods. In
Subjective Advertising, the focus is shifted
away from promoting a brand or product and
instead places the emphasis on addressing
real-world problems and providing effective
solutions. It can be summarized as "brandless,
problem-oriented advertising."
